# Workflowy-API
A Python API for Workflowy, a nested note taking application. An official API is not currently available, so I made this for personal use until Workflowy releases an official API. Inspiration was drawn from another unofficial API created in PHP by another user here: https://github.com/johansatge/workflowy-php.
